It is involved in maintaining cellular integrity and membrane stability by cap-binding the fast-growing ends of actin filaments.\n• Reasoning & Supporting Information: The biological effects of ADD3 are influenced by its interaction with other proteins, such as spectrin, that regulates cell shape, motility and integrity.\n\nPAWR (PRKC apoptosis WT1 regulator)\n• Role: PAWR, also known as Par-4, is involved in the induction of cell apoptosis. It induces apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.\n• Reasoning & Supporting Information: PAWR has been identified as a pro-apoptotic protein due to its ability to interact with various anti-apoptotic proteins, thereby dictating survival or death of a cell.\n\nTOM1 (Target of Myb1)\n• Role: TOM1 is involved in endosomal trafficking and autophagy, which is an essential intracellular degradation system that helps maintain cellular homeostasis.\n• Reasoning & Supporting Information: TOM1 is known for its role in various intracellular activities, such as protein sorting, membrane traffic, organelle biogenesis and autophagosome formation.\n\nTOM1L2 (Target of Myb1-like 2)\n• Role: TOM1L2 is also involved in endosomal trafficking and possibly has a role in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling pathway.\n• Reasoning & Supporting Information: TOM1L2 is hypothesized to participate in protein transport and membrane trafficking, potentially acting as a link between endosomes and the actin cytoskeleton, which is integral to maintaining cellular structure and organization.\n\nSummary: The proteins depicted in this system primarily regulate cytoskeletal remodeling and cell apoptosis processes. ADD3 influence on actin dynamics helps in maintaining cell shape and membrane stability. PAWR’s role as a pro-apoptotic protein indicates its relevance in controlling cell survival. TOM1 and TOM1L2 functions in endosomal trafficking play crucial roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis. The combined activity of these proteins speaks to their overall importance in directed cell shaping, cell death, and timely degradation of unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components."
